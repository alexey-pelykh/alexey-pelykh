## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

I&apos;m Alexey and I started my software engineering journey more than 20 years ago.
The selected greatest and craziest adventures thus far are:

- expanding the media tech frontier at Verizon Media / Yahoo Ryot Lab by building
  [PlayAR](https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-media-nfl-fan-experience),
  Yahoo Immersive, and internal cloud rendering cluster with Unreal Engine with Pixel Streaming, SideFX Houdini,
  Adobe AfterEffects and Remotion;
- building [a software agency](https://clutch.co/profile/brainbean-apps) that earned
  [a 2020 recognition award](https://clutch.co/press-releases/recognizes-top-b2b-companies-estonia);
- contributing [almost 100 Odoo Community modules](https://odoo-community.org/shop?&search=CorporateHub) that help
  operating hundreds of service companies and getting assignment to
  [the project steering committees](https://github.com/orgs/OCA/teams?query=%40alexey-pelykh) as a recognition;
- opening [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net) to the iOS market and 3D maps & cartography league by delivering a brand-new
  [OpenGLES-based core](https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-core/graphs/contributors) that got me
  [a Wikipedia mention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsmAnd) as OsmAnd&apos;s developer;
- building [an inertial motion capture system](https://www.youtube.com/@3DSuit) at
  [Inertial Labs](https://inertiallabs.com/) and contributing to the
  [Linux Kernel](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Atorvalds%2Flinux+Alexey+Pelykh&type=commits) to make it possible;
- expanding the AR/VR tech frontier at [Innalabs](https://www.innalabs.com/) with MEMS-based 6DOF &ldquo;mouse&rdquo;,
  motion-capture VR training systems with stereo vision;
- authoring a MIPS III R5900-based &ldquo;[Emotion Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_Engine)&rdquo; CPU
  emulator for the company&apos;s security research enabling it to detect and verify the signatures and watermarks on
  the bootloader.

My passion lies in the hands-on exploration of the software engineering frontiers.
